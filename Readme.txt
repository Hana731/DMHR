Assignment B [50 marks]
WHO Mortality Database
The WHO Mortality Database is a database of registered deaths compiled by WHO from data given by national authorities around the world. The cause of each death is classified by the circumstances that led to death. For this exercise, you will use data which report the cause of death using the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). All of this information is collated into a number of Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, which can be found on the WHO Mortality Database website. The year of interest is 2010.
Each country in the database is uniquely identified all WHO datasets by a four digit numeric code. The mapping between countries and identifier codes is located in the "Country codes" lookup file. Information on the population of each country is found in the "Population and live births" file.
